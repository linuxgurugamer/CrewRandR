This is a revival of the mod CrewQueue, which was orignially written by @enneract in 2015.  Original thread is here:  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97702-10x-crewqueue-crew-rotation-and-vacations/

The mod had been updated by @Starwaster for 1.1.3, which is where I cloned the source code from.

Crew R&R

This mod is focused around the idea of encouraging the player to keep a deeper roster of crew, and to increase the value of individual experienced crew.

This mod gives crew members a 'cool-down' when they return to Kerbin, so that you need to use a more varied crew rather than just Bill, Bob, and Jeb. It also changes which crew are automatically selected, so that the most-experienced crew who has least-recently been on a mission is picked first.

Features

Crew go on R&R after completing a mission, between 7 and 28 days in length, depending on the length of their mission. (configurable in the stock Settings page)
While on R&R, crew cannot be sent on missions.
The main pod is crewed with the highest-level crew who has least-recently been on a mission, creating a sort of 'crew rotation'.
Crew assigned to pods, either automatically or with the 'fill' button, will make some sense in regard to what that part does. For example, Science Labs will get mostly Scientists, Cockpits will get at least one Pilot, etc.
